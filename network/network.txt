Fixed config from Cloud Provisioning:
Available IP-range is                   10.253.0.0/25    128 addresses
Subnet for VPN Rabo-Azure westeurope is 10.253.0.112/29    8 addresses

Chosen config based on this:

VNET westeurope                         10.253.0.64/26    64 addresses

VNET northeurope                        10.253.0.0/26     64 addresses

minimum subnet is /29, 8 addresses, of which we can use 4 (we cannot use the first 4 addresses per subnet)
BEB                                     +0/29
Cassandra                               +8/29
Elasticsearch                           +16/29
spare range                             +24/29
Glue                                    +32/29
Jumpbox                                 +40/29
Reserved for rabo-azure gateway         +48/29
Gateway between azure regions           +56/29

So 4 addresses per region per subnet, max 8 VM's (2 regions) for every cluster in test.
